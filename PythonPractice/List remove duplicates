import random

# will create 2 lists containing numbers from range 1-9. So basically one duplicate of each. Then make a new list by adding them together. Then create a set
a = random.sample(range(10),10)
b = random.sample(range(10),10)
c = a+b

set(c)


#This can also be accomplished with a simple function
def remove_dups(x):
    e = set(x)
    return (e)
